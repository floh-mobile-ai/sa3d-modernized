# SA3D Modernized - Quick Start Guide

## What We've Built

We've successfully created the foundation for the SA3D Modernized platform:

### ✅ Completed Components

1. **Shared Library**
   - Common data models (User, Project, Analysis, etc.)
   - Utility functions (validation, error handling, logging)
   - Comprehensive unit tests (all passing!)

2. **API Gateway Service**
   - JWT authentication
   - Request routing and proxying
   - Middleware (logging, CORS, rate limiting)
   - Health checks
   - WebSocket support (stub)

3. **Analysis Service**
   - Go code analyzer using AST
   - Metrics calculator
   - Worker pool for concurrent processing
   - Integration with PostgreSQL, Redis, and Kafka

4. **Infrastructure**
   - PostgreSQL 16 (Database)
   - Redis 7 (Caching & Sessions)
   - Apache Kafka (Event Streaming)
   - Zookeeper (Kafka Coordination)
   - Docker Compose setup

## Running the Project

### Prerequisites
- Docker Desktop installed and running
- Git (for cloning the repository)

### Quick Start

1. **Start Infrastructure Services**
   ```bash
   # Windows
   docker-compose -f docker-compose.infra.yml up -d
   
   # Or use the helper script
   scripts\dev.bat infra
   ```

2. **Verify Infrastructure**
   ```bash
   # Windows
   scripts\test-infra.bat
   ```

3. **Run Tests**
   ```bash
   # Windows - Run shared library tests in Docker
   scripts\test-docker.bat
   ```

### Service Endpoints (when running)

- **API Gateway**: http://localhost:8080
- **Analysis Service**: http://localhost:8081 (internal)
- **PostgreSQL**: localhost:5432
- **Redis**: localhost:6379
- **Kafka**: localhost:9092

### Development Notes

The services are designed to run with Go 1.23. Since Go is not installed on this system, we've set up Docker-based development and testing workflows.

To run the services locally, you would need to:
1. Install Go 1.23
2. Run `go mod download` in each service directory
3. Use the Makefile commands or run directly with `go run`

### Next Steps

1. **Fix Module Dependencies**: The services need proper module setup to import internal packages
2. **Create Database Migrations**: Set up database schema
3. **Implement Remaining Services**: Visualization, Collaboration, Metrics
4. **Build Frontend**: React + TypeScript + Three.js
5. **Add Integration Tests**: Test services working together
6. **Set up CI/CD**: Automated testing and deployment

```

## Troubleshooting

### Services won't build
- The import paths need to be fixed for internal packages
- Consider using Go workspaces or vendoring

### Infrastructure issues
- Ensure Docker Desktop is running
- Check port conflicts (5432, 6379, 9092)
- Use `docker-compose -f docker-compose.infra.yml logs` to debug

### Test failures
- The shared library tests are passing
- Service tests require proper module setup
