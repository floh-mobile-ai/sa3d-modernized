## Security-Integrated Development Strategy

**Security Philosophy**: Security is embedded as a first-class concern throughout all development phases, not an afterthought. Critical security vulnerabilities must be resolved before proceeding with new feature development.

## Security Audit Findings & Immediate Actions Required

### CRITICAL Security Issues (MUST FIX - Week 1-2)
- **Mock Authentication System**: Replace with production-ready user management
- **Hardcoded Secrets**: JWT secret and database credentials exposed in config
- **Missing Authorization**: No proper user database or role verification
- **Database Credentials**: Plaintext passwords in Docker compose

### HIGH PRIORITY Security Issues (MUST FIX - Week 2-3)  
- **Input Validation**: Missing comprehensive request validation
- **Rate Limiting**: Basic implementation needs enhancement for DDoS protection
- **CORS Configuration**: Overly permissive origin handling
- **Request Size Limits**: No protection against large payload attacks

### MEDIUM PRIORITY Security Issues (FIX - Week 3-4)
- **Container Security**: Run containers as non-root (partially implemented)
- **Service-to-Service Authentication**: No inter-service security
- **Security Headers**: Missing HSTS, CSP, and other protective headers
