# Claude Code Pro User Constraints - SA3D Modernized Project

## Document Purpose
This document tracks all Claude Code usage constraints and limitations for Pro users to ensure development work stays within platform bounds and optimize productivity throughout the SA3D Modernized project development lifecycle.

**Last Updated**: August 3, 2025  
**Source Data**: Anthropic Official Documentation & TechCrunch Reports  
**Next Review**: Weekly (every Monday)

## Current Plan Status
- **Plan Type**: Pro Plan ($20/month) - Assumed
- **Rate Limit Structure**: 5-hour rolling sessions + Weekly limits (effective August 28, 2025)

---

## 1. Usage Limits

### 1.1 5-Hour Rolling Session Limits (Current)
| Metric | Pro Plan Limit | Notes |
|--------|----------------|-------|
| Claude Code Prompts | 10-40 per session | Varies by code complexity and file size |
| Claude Messages | ~45 per session | Shared with regular Claude usage |
| Session Reset | Every 5 hours | Clock starts with first prompt |
| Model Access | Sonnet 4 only | No Opus 4 access on Pro |

### 1.2 Weekly Rate Limits (Starting August 28, 2025)
| Metric | Pro Plan Allocation | Impact Level |
|--------|-------------------|--------------|
| Sonnet 4 Hours | 40-80 hours/week | Medium - requires planning |
| Opus 4 Hours | 0 hours | High - no access |
| Usage Tracking | Shared across Claude & Claude Code | High - monitor total usage |
| Reset Frequency | Every 7 days | Medium - predictable cycles |

### 1.3 Repository Size Recommendations
- **Optimal**: Under 1,000 lines of code
- **Current SA3D Project**: Multi-service architecture (~2,000+ lines estimated)
- **Impact**: Higher token consumption per prompt due to larger context

## 2. Feature Restrictions

### 2.1 Model Access Limitations
| Feature | Pro Plan Access | Workaround |
|---------|----------------|------------|
| Opus 4 Model | ❌ Not Available | Use Sonnet 4 for all tasks |
| Model Switching | ❌ No automatic switching | Manual prompt optimization |
| Advanced Reasoning | ⚠️ Limited | Break complex tasks into smaller prompts |

### 2.2 File Processing Constraints
| Constraint | Limit | SA3D Impact |
|------------|-------|-------------|
| File Upload Size | Not specified | Monitor large Go files |
| Concurrent File Analysis | Limited by prompt quota | Process services sequentially |
| Binary File Analysis | Limited support | Focus on source code only |

---

## 3. Time-Based Constraints

### 3.1 Session Management
```
Session Timeline:
Hour 0: ████████████████████ (100% - 10-40 prompts available)
Hour 1: ████████████████░░░░ (80% - Monitor usage)
Hour 2: ████████████░░░░░░░░ (60% - Reduce prompt frequency)
Hour 3: ████████░░░░░░░░░░░░ (40% - Critical tasks only)
Hour 4: ████░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░ (20% - Emergency use only)
Hour 5: ████████████████████ (RESET - Full quota restored)
```

### 3.2 Weekly Planning (Post-August 28)
| Day | Recommended Usage | Project Focus |
|-----|------------------|---------------|
| Monday | 25% (10-20 hours) | Architecture & Planning |
| Tuesday | 25% (10-20 hours) | Core Development |
| Wednesday | 25% (10-20 hours) | Testing & Integration |
| Thursday | 15% (6-12 hours) | Bug Fixes & Reviews |
| Friday | 10% (4-8 hours) | Documentation & Cleanup |
| Weekend | Reserve | Emergency fixes only |

---

## 4. Project-Specific Constraints

### 4.1 SA3D Service Development Priority
Based on constraints, prioritize development in this order:

1. **Shared Library** ✅ (Completed - minimal ongoing changes)
2. **API Gateway** ✅ (Completed - focus on testing only)
3. **Analysis Service** ✅ (Completed - optimization phase)
4. **Visualization Service** (High priority - complex algorithms)
5. **Metrics Service** (Medium priority - data processing)
6. **Collaboration Service** (Low priority - real-time features)

### 4.2 Token Optimization Strategies
| Strategy | Implementation | Estimated Savings |
|----------|----------------|-------------------|
| Focused File Reading | Read only specific files per session | 30-40% |
| Service Isolation | Work on one service at a time | 25-35% |
| Incremental Development | Small, focused changes | 20-30% |
| Template Reuse | Reuse patterns across services | 15-25% |

---

## 5. Monitoring & Tracking

### 5.1 Usage Tracking Checklist
- [ ] **Daily**: Monitor prompt count per 5-hour session
- [ ] **Weekly**: Track total usage against weekly limits (post-Aug 28)
- [ ] **Per Task**: Estimate prompt requirements before starting
- [ ] **Per Service**: Track tokens consumed per microservice

### 5.2 Warning Thresholds
| Threshold | Action Required |
|-----------|----------------|
| 75% of session used | Switch to planning/documentation |
| 85% of session used | Emergency tasks only |
| 90% of weekly limit | Defer non-critical work |
| 95% of weekly limit | Stop development work |

### 5.3 Optimization Metrics
```
Target Efficiency Metrics:
- Prompts per feature: <5 prompts
- Session utilization: 80-90%
- Weekly planning accuracy: >85%
- Token waste rate: <15%
```

## 6. Mitigation Strategies

### 6.1 Development Workflow Adaptations
1. **Batch Processing**: Group related changes into single prompts
2. **Preparation Time**: Plan changes during non-development hours
3. **Documentation**: Use constraint-free time for planning documents
4. **Code Review**: Use external tools for preliminary review

### 6.2 Emergency Procedures
| Scenario | Response Plan |
|----------|---------------|
| Quota Exhausted | Switch to manual coding, resume next session |
| Critical Bug | Use reserved quota, document for session planning |
| Deadline Pressure | Prioritize core functionality over nice-to-haves |
| Weekly Limit Hit | Focus on testing, documentation, manual work |

### 6.3 Alternative Tools & Approaches
- **Local Development**: Use local IDE for simple changes
- **Code Generation**: Use templates for repetitive code
- **Manual Testing**: Reduce reliance on Claude Code for test generation
- **Documentation**: Write docs manually to preserve quota

## 7. Success Metrics & KPIs

### 7.1 Constraint Compliance
- **Target**: Stay within 90% of all usage limits
- **Measurement**: Weekly usage reports
- **Review**: Monday planning sessions

### 7.2 Development Velocity
